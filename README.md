### Fun with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)

A place to store the projects from `phaser` tutorials.

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder, e.g: `cd platformer`
3. In the `/app` folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.\
  *Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
  In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, start up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.*
